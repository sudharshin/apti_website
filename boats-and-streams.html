            <h2>1. A boat can travel 30 km upstream in 6 hours. If the speed of the stream is 5 km/h, find the speed of the boat in still water.</h2>
            <button onclick="toggleExplanation(1)">Show Explanation</button>
            <p class="explanation">Let the speed of the boat in still water be x km/h. Then, the speed of the boat upstream is (x - 5) km/h. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we have 30 km / (x - 5) km/h = 6 hours. Solving this equation, we find x = 10 km/h. Therefore, the speed of the boat in still water is 10 km/h.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>2. A man rows to a place 48 km away and back in 14 hours. If the speed of the stream is 3 km/h, find the speed of the man in still water.</h2>
            <button onclick="toggleExplanation(2)">Show Explanation</button>
            <p class="explanation">Let the speed of the man in still water be x km/h. Then, the speed of the man downstream is (x + 3) km/h and the speed of the man upstream is (x - 3) km/h. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we have 48 km / (x + 3) km/h + 48 km / (x - 3) km/h = 14 hours. Solving this equation, we find x = 6 km/h. Therefore, the speed of the man in still water is 6 km/h.</p>

        <div class="question">
            <h2>3. A boat takes 3 hours to row downstream a distance of 36 km and 4 hours to row the same distance upstream. Find the speed of the boat and the speed of the stream.</h2>
            <button onclick="toggleExplanation(3)">Show Explanation</button>
            <p class="explanation">Let the speed of the boat in still water be x km/h and the speed of the stream be y km/h. Then, the speed of the boat downstream is (x + y) km/h and the speed of the boat upstream is (x - y) km/h. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we have 36 km / (x + y) km/h = 3 hours and 36 km / (x - y) km/h = 4 hours. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find x = 10 km/h and y = 2 km/h. Therefore, the speed of the boat is 10 km/h and the speed of the stream is 2 km/h.</p>

            <h2>4. A boat can row 10 km/h in still water. It takes 2 hours to row upstream a distance and 1 hour to row downstream the same distance. Find the speed of the stream.</h2>
            <button onclick="toggleExplanation(4)">Show Explanation</button>
            <p class="explanation">Let the speed of the stream be y km/h. Then, the speed of the boat upstream is (10 - y) km/h and the speed of the boat downstream is (10 + y) km/h. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we have Distance / (10 - y) = 2 hours and Distance / (10 + y) = 1 hour. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find y = 5 km/h. Therefore, the speed of the stream is 5 km/h.</p>

            <h2>5. A boat covers a certain distance downstream in 3 hours while it takes 6 hours to cover the same distance upstream. If the speed of the stream is 3 km/h, find the speed of the boat in still water.</h2>
            <button onclick="toggleExplanation(5)">Show Explanation</button>
            <p class="explanation">Let the speed of the boat in still water be x km/h. Then, the speed of the boat downstream is (x + 3) km/h and the speed of the boat upstream is (x - 3) km/h. Using the formula Time = Distance / Speed, we have Distance / (x + 3) = 3 hours and Distance / (x - 3) = 6 hours. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find x = 9 km/h. Therefore, the speed of the boat in still water is 9 km/h.</p>
