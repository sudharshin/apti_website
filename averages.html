            <button onclick="toggleExplanation(1)">Show Explanation</button>
            <p class="explanation">The sum of the five numbers is 5 * 20 = 100. If one of the numbers is 15, then the sum of the remaining four numbers is 100 - 15 = 85. Therefore, the average of the remaining four numbers is 85 / 4 = 21.25.</p>

            <h2>2. The average of six numbers is 18. If one of the numbers is 24, what is the average of the remaining five numbers?</h2>
            <button onclick="toggleExplanation(2)">Show Explanation</button>
            <p class="explanation">The sum of the six numbers is 6 * 18 = 108. If one of the numbers is 24, then the sum of the remaining five numbers is 108 - 24 = 84. Therefore, the average of the remaining five numbers is 84 / 5 = 16.8.</p>

            <h2>3. The average age of a group of ten friends is 25 years. If the age of one of the friends is 30 years, what is the average age of the remaining nine friends?</h2>
            <button onclick="toggleExplanation(3)">Show Explanation</button>
            <p class="explanation">The sum of the ages of the ten friends is 10 * 25 = 250 years. If one of the friends is 30 years old, then the sum of the ages of the remaining nine friends is 250 - 30 = 220 years. Therefore, the average age of the remaining nine friends is 220 / 9 ≈ 24.44 years.</p>

            <button onclick="toggleExplanation(4)">Show Explanation</button>
            <p class="explanation">The sum of the weights of the four boxes is 4 * 12 kg = 48 kg. If one of the boxes weighs 16 kg, then the sum of the weights of the remaining three boxes is 48 kg - 16 kg = 32 kg. Therefore, the average weight of the remaining three boxes is 32 kg / 3 ≈ 10.67 kg.</p>

            <p class="explanation">The sum of the scores of the four tests is 4 * 80 = 320. If the student scores 90 in the fifth test, then the new sum of scores is 320 + 90 = 410. Therefore, the new average score is 410 / 5 = 82.</p>
